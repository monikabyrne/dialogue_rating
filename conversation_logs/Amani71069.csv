Have you lost your pleasure in food?,Food tastes different since the radiation therapy so I haven't been that into eating recently.

Are you managing financially?,Food definitely tastes different since the radiation therapy. It's so disappointing when I eat my favourite foods and they taste wrong. And the pain when I swallow makes me want to skip meals altogether.,personal_social.coping,Amani71069,12/05/2024 18:43
Do you skip many meals?,"I've been eating less because food tastes strange to me now. I have breakfast, lunch and dinner but my portions are much smaller than I used to eat. I can't eat much in one go because it's really painful.",main_complaint.number_of_meals,Amani71069,12/05/2024 18:43

"Ok, so what size bites do you need to cut them into?",If food gets stuck I have to drink a lot of water and swallow a lot to get it down. I cough sometimes too when I swallow. It can help if I cut my food into small bites and avoid tougher foods.,main_complaint.what_helps_swallow,Amani71069,12/05/2024 18:46
Does mealtime take longer?,It takes me much longer to eat food I have to chew even if I take small bites. Especially since I get so worried about having a choking fit and I end up eating way more slowly than I probably have to. If I eat something like soup I can eat pretty normally. My meals can take 30 to 40 minutes.,main_complaint.longer_mealtimes,Amani71069,12/05/2024 18:47
